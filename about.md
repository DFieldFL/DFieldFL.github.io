title: About Me
---

I'm a Software Engineer who is a proud graduate from the University of Central Florida with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering and a Master of Science in Modeling and Simulation. I enjoy attending local developer meetiups like Orlando Devs and UCF sporting events. Java, Python and Javascript are a few languages I like developing in. I'm also interested in Linux, Docker, Big Data and IoT.
